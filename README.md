##US First
The orgranization that puts together the competitions and infrastructure for us is [US First](http://www.usfirst.org).  They coordinate competitions for many skill levels and types, so here's a direct link to the page for our section, the [First Robotics Competition](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc) (FRC).  This is the page to check for announcements about our competition task.

There's a well made documentary about US First and the competitions called [RoboLeague Documentary](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/roboleague2015) that showcases 2015 FIRST championship.  It's well worth the 50 minutes of time to watch.

[There's a calendar of important FRC dates on the site.](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/calendar/list)

####Important Dates
**Saturday, January 9, 2016**, 10:30-11:30 AM (ET) (9:30-10:30 Central). 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition Kickoff.
This is when we find out all the technical details of what our robot needs to accomplish.  

**Tuesday, February 23, 2016**, 11:59 PM (Central). Stop Build time.  All teams must stop work on the robot and seal it,using the bag and tag provided in the 2016 Kit of Parts.  So, we have 45 days to design, build, program, and test our robot.  Then, it needs to be trapped in a bag until...

**Wednesday, April 6 to Saturday, April 9, 2016**. In Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota. So, after 6 weeks of being isolated and alone, we let our robot loose in our competition.  There are about 60 teams registered for our competition.  During the same time, there will also be 60 more teams competing across the street from where we are, in Mariucci Arena.

###Chief Delphi
There's a portal I've seen mentioned when I've searched for information about US First and FRC called [Chief Delphi](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/portal.php).  This appears to be an unofficial gathering place of different US First teams.  It contains plenty of gossip, but appears to have a lot of helpful information on technical matters as well.

## APIs and Libraries

- [OpenRIO](https://github.com/Open-RIO) - A group of people (including our own Paul) have been working on tools and libraries that will help make building robots for the the FRC easier and more flexible.  They have several projects that we'll be working with for this season's competition, including:
 - [Toast](https://github.com/Open-RIO/ToastAPI) - An expandable, Open Source and Cross-Platform Robot API for FRC built on WPILib
 - [HotPlate](https://github.com/Open-RIO/HotPlate) - CLI for the creation of Toast modules
 - [ToastLUA](https://github.com/Open-RIO/ToastLUA) - Lua is a programming language that been used successfully in "scripting" several commercial games.  We'll be using this version to quickly add functionality to our robot when we find out which other teams will be in our alliance once the competition starts.
